<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thanks for checking out my website. I just started learning web development so this site is bare bones basic.</p>

<p>I recently completed an Associates in Computer Science and, as part of improving my skills and building on top my my degree, 
    I decided to learn web development. I'm not sure if I'll ever try to do this as a career, but it would be great to know and 
    be able to do on the side for myself, family, or friends. Hopefully with time I'll be able to me legit websites that look super nice.
    Any advice is always welcome.

<p>If you haven't already noticed, the "Contact Me" page is for show only just to give me practice. I saw no need to actually put 
    any contact info in there.
