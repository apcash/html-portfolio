<h1>Adrian's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Some of my favorite movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Other Guys</h3>
<p>Super funny. Great plot. Will Ferral is always great. Mark Walburg is a surprisingly good actor, and pretty funny.</p>

<h3>Tammy</h3>
<p>Melissa McCarthy in another incredibly funny role. She's definitely one of my favorite actors. Non-stop laughs the entire time.</p>

<h3>Ghostbusters</h3>
<p>All of them are pretty good, but the originals are definitely the best. I couldn't choose one so just included them all here. The all female<br /> version was actually 
pretty good. I didn't have high hopes but they chose some good actresses for it. Melissa McCarthy, once again.</p>

<h3>Spirited</h3>
<p>Adding another here I forgot. Didn't feel like deleting what I just wrote, plus more practice!</p>

<p>Another Will Ferrel movie. This time Ryan Reynalds is his co-star. He's another of my favorite actors. Also includes Tracy Morgan who <br />
is yet another of my top actors. Super funny movie and in the style of a musical which I appreciate on occasion.</p>
